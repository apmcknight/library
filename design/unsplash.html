      <p>Designs often benefit from photography.
        However, designers are limited on resources
        while working for-themselves, or their company
        may not provide a budget to buy stock photography.
        This is where Unsplash solves a problem.
        Unsplash is a collection of copyright free
        photographs, where thousands of photographers
        around the world post their beautiful high-quality
        photos; for anyone to use!</p>
